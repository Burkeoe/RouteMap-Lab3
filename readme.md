# Lab 3 Summary
My goal when making this web map was to show a route on foot that I have taken several times after studying at the library. I have gone a couple different ways before, and some are definitely better and quicker than others. This map shows the most efficient way to get to App Cookie Co. The function of the web map is to have an interactive way to view the route, so you can zoom in and see the streets and turns as well as have some stops in between that I have deemed potentially useful. The libraries used in the creation of the map include Leaflet, an open source JavaScript library used to make interactive web maps, and Jquery, a JavaScript library designed to make things like HTML simpler. The data source for the map information came from GeoJSON.io, a website where you can download spatial data to GeoJSON format.
